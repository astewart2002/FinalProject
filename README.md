I have no idea why this code is so temperamental. The colour changing according to frequencies (using FFT sound analysis) only works sometimes when I load the browser? I thought it was because it was waiting for a user input like mouse click to start but this wasn't it. Also my computer web cam and mic are terrible so I can't tell if this is all just a horrendous output but I spent a long time on this. Anywho!
